The mother's medical history included obesity, bacterial vaginosis and she was positive for group B streptococcus.  The mother's concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) as vitamin supplementation.   The mother did not have any previous pregnancies, nor maternal and paternal history with major congenital malformation (MCM). The mother did not consume tobacco, alcohol and illicit-drugs during pregnancy.  The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 25-Mar-2019. The mother's estimated date of delivery (EDD) was 30-Dec-2019 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was 06-Dec-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The father  was 28-year-old. The pregnancy was complicated by bacterial vaginosis and the mother was treated with metronidazole vaginal gel, one applicator every day via vaginal route of administration.  On 05-Jun-2019, the subject's mother underwent first trimester screen and nuchal translucency and no MCM was noted.  On 02-Jul-2019, the subject's mother underwent second trimester screen and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening (MSAFP/serum markers) and no o MCM was noted.  On 11-Jul-2019, the subject underwent anatomy ultrasound and no MCM was noted.  On 16-Sep-2019, at 25 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Flucelvax QIVc [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent; batch number: 261200, dose, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as 'Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation.

At gestational age of 40.6 weeks, the mother vaginally delivered live male neonate. The neonate birth weight was 3470 grams and no data was reported for head circumference and length. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at one minute was 8 and at five minutes was 9. No data was reported for APGAR score at ten minutes. No MCM was identified at birth.

On 2/8 I saw a doctor who tested my electrolytes. Everything was good with labs. I was declining rapidly. I started to become very lightheaded and dizzy. I had blurred vision. I started to get migraines. On 2/11 I saw another doctor who did a bunch of tests like vertigo, said she could not figure it out. The migraines were severe and consistent. On 2/15 I went to the ER. They did a CT scan, EKG, more blood tests. She said she would diagnose me with migraines although I never had an issue with them before, and she was diagnosing me with it as a \"diagnosis of exclusion\". I was bedridden. I had spots in my vision and couldn't drive. I felt like I was driving drunk although completely sober so I stopped driving. I had severe brain fog. I couldn't remember what happened 2 minutes ago.  They prescribed me propranolol and a triptan. I didn't take them because I felt that the diagnosis was wrong. Something was causing migraines, my whole body was experiencing something major. On 2/19 I went to another doctor for another set of eyes. I told him what I was feeling was systemic. I had been out of work for weeks. He tested me for B12 and Magnesium deficiencies. Everything was normal. I googled nonstop. I started feeling zaps like my body needed oxygen. My brain needed oxygen. The brain fog was so severe I felt like I had dementia. I kept googling... I came across iron... I started to take iron on 2/21. I went to the VA for more blood tests. The blood tests had some low markers like eGFR and slightly low MCHC. I was clearly very sick. The same day I could barely breathe well and I went to the ER. The doctor told me he \"deals with strokes and heart attacks\" and not what was happening to me. I asked him to please check my ferritin. He refused. I kept taking iron. On 2/22 I went to another ER with shortness of breath and all of the other symptoms. I felt like I was going to die. I had never been so sick. I am a very healthy person who eats healthy and exercises daily. This doctor refused to test my ferritin as well. She told me it was stress. I ordered my own labs using walkinlabs.com. I had read that ferritin can be falsely elevated if the body was inflamed and I'm pretty sure that's what happened because at the time my ferritin was normal at 48. I kept taking large doses of iron (within safe limits) because my symptoms matched iron deficiency without anemia and the causes of it fit me. I read many many medical journals regarding our ferritin ranges and how ferritin should be 75+. I had never had an issue with it before. I swore it was iron. Every day 2-3 symptoms would go away.  I saw another doctor shortly after who dismissed all of my symptoms again. It was the sickest I had ever been and 4 doctors, 3 ER's all dismissed me. I was beyond frustrated and lost faith in the medical community. Some mentioned it could be the vaccine but they did not question it too much. I went to a naturopathic doctor. She did a thorough test on 3/9. My ferritin came out as a 21 on this date (after 16 days of taking large amounts of iron). She thought maybe I was already iron deficient and that when I got the shot, maybe my immune system couldn't handle both. I left it at that.  Meanwhile, another coworker, had also been out 3 weeks. He had deteriorated severely about the same amount of time after the Moderna Vaccine that I did. I didn't think much of it as he had diverticulitis. He is also a healthy eater and exerciser. Today he is still very ill. Today he told me that his Kidney doctor just found out that his Iron was completely depleted! His labs were off the charts low. Coincidence maybe, but too similar to not consider as an adverse reaction to the shot! And how many people may have the same symptoms who don't know? As of today I am still very weak and tired but I am able to work.  I don't feel as sharp. Iron did fix a lot of the symptoms but iron deficiency usually comes on slower.

There was nothing new to her routine except like when Prilosec was taken off the market, she got a different medication for it. She has been on all of these for long term maintenance.  Historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19MAR2021 (at the age of 64-year-old)(Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) for covid-19 vaccination, adverse events following prior vaccinations: none; and flu vaccine for immunization in last fall, 2020. She has a history of obscure side effects to medication, things that people have never heard of and she is the 1 in a million that has ever had these problems. The patient previously took ondansetron (ZOFRAN), (\"a chemotherapy treatment\", given before chemotherapy), which gave her a homicidal migraine and they had to give her ice packs for her head; 9 rounds of \"Cytox\" (Cytoxin or Cytoxan) she was not sure how this was spelled, and chemotherapy (9 rounds of chemo); azathioprine (IMURAN), she does not know if it was spelled Immuran or Imuran; prednisone a number of years and she said to her rheumatologist, \"it did not make sense on an intellectual basis that the prednisone being effective in her body as it was once\" and he said he would give her IMURAN which is given to kidney patients to cause less of a reaction with the organ, and patient mentioned she had barely an immune system after all these years on prednisone, she went through 3 rounds of steroids; Heparin IV, which  made her arm feel on fire on the inside, which they would not give her a flush when she had IV treatment; Dextrose IV made her skin feel hot and itchy, her mouth felt like she put something in that had been soaking in rubbing alcohol; ciprofloxacin (reported as \"Cipro\"), she had a bad reaction to Cipro, she was given after she was bit by a dog on her calves, she knew it was attached to and is \"hurting her calves the rest of her life/the podiatrist said if it has not gone away, she is kind of stuck\" (as reported, not specified). The patient just wanted to give Pfizer a full picture of what she was dealing with and she is an unusual case. She added that chemo was in the 90s and that is when all of the medication reactions she mentioned were. She absolutely does not have any of the information about the products she mentioned she had previous reactions to. Every time they did \"this\", it \"hurt\" and she asked them not to do it anymore. She asked them to not do dextrose anymore with the chemo because it feels like it is on fire, and she asked them to mix it with saline. She did not have any additional information, did not have the NDC, LOT, expiration date, or manufacturer for any of these medications she reported historical adverse events on. The patient reported that she got her 2nd shot of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. She has soreness at the site, more-so several hours after getting the vaccine (09Apr2021). Just her arm felt sore within moments after the second vaccine, but she did not get this after the first. She rested and took it easy that weekend. There was Sore, Tired, general lethargy, and fatigue (Apr2021): when she looked online, it really only told her what everyone knows about that you might be sore and tired and she had all that, she thought she was through with all of that. She had no chills, just general lethargy and fatigue. She was sluggish and tired and not herself that weekend (Apr 2021). She stayed home so it is difficulty to say. Her arm was definitely sore. For sluggishness and fatigue, she said that she has been a couch potato for a year, it comes with the territory with lockdown and being depressed, so it is difficult to decide if it is health or physically induced or a emotional base. She did not knowingly spike a fever, no chills or sweats. And on Monday (did not clarify dates but states it was Monday after 09APR2021, throughout the weekend she took it easy), she noticed with her foot, she had difficulty getting out of bed could not put weight on her right foot. She was alarmed. She stayed home and rested and did a lot of napping and taking it slow. It is still difficulty and moving certain ways hurts more if she flexes. She has a known history of tendonitis so she wore her brace in the meantime. She thought maybe she had tendonitis in both ankles and this was similar so maybe it was a different set of tendons. She would wear a brace, and eventually it will get better in time. She also was wearing braces like compression socks that toes stick out of. She thought she had tendonitis and that is what she has done in the past. It has been a month and she is not better. This was her left foot, most of the pain was focused on the sole of her foot towards the outer edge. That is where it started. Then it migrated over time. That was weird and had her worried. It was all in her arch in the initial spot. She notes it is not like the tendonitis she had the first time. She does not want to be an alarmist or have her doctor think she is a hypochondriac she waited. She was then rubbing her foot, the right one, and noticed it was tender on the top of her foot just like the left one. There was sore. There was pain in right foot, pain in feet. Pain in feet, her left foot had most of the pain on the top and bottom and a lot of it is along the outer part of her sole of the foot. In her right foot, the pain is mostly at the fleshy part below her toes and on top of her foot. The pain moved around into the other foot for about a month so she went to the podiatrist yesterday (06May2021) and doctor did x-rays. The night before (05May2021), the opposite leg had a line of black and blue dots on her right calf that went up her leg, she did not notice this until Wednesday (05May2021) evening because she never examines it. She soaped up a washcloth and she knew where her parts are in the bath. Her mind wanders and she was not looking. She happened to be wearing something where her legs were not covered and that is how she knew. It did not hurt. It was strange, looking like bruising in a line. The doctor said it was all like one vein and he cold feel it. She can not feel it, but he could. The doctor told her these could be clots. She still has them. Doctor said the other leg where she had the pain was only soft tissue pain. Doctor found that every place that hurt when he touched it and it still hurts where he had touched it. She was told she does not have arthritis and she has had arthritis since she was 13. The doctor did not know what it is. It was her left foot constantly, and the right foot hurt off and on during that period. The left for sure was kind of a dull ache and throbbing. The right was only a little bit. The left was worse. It appeared to be soft tissue that was hurting and he said there are so many side effects of this new vaccine and to maybe try heat or ice. Ever since the patient left doctor's office until now (the time of reporting) she did not known if she need to be concerned, that if she does not know what it is, can ice or heat make it worse? She did not know the next steps. Treatment, she tried to keep it elevated because that can not hurt but that is about it. She has not done heat and ice because if the doctor does not know what it is, how does he know it will not make it worse. He asked if she could take aspirin and she said no she is allergic to aspirin. Tylenol she does not take often, only when she feels like she needs it and she has not been doing it often. When she stays off it, it does not hurt as much as when she is walking. She wanted  to know if she should be worried and she wanted to add (report this) to the database if this is a side effect and if Pfizer has ever heard of this before. There was also tired, general lethargy, and fatigue. At this point when reporting, she is single and lives alone, and said that \"God forbid something happens, there is nobody to say let's get you to a hospital\". She heard about blood clots on the news. When they said blood clot yesterday, it was a red warning light going on and a siren. At the time of reporting it was Friday and she did not know that if she need to rush to the hospital. Her primary care physician (PCP) said she had never heard of this and to call Pfizer. The patient asked if she is one of a small group of people this has happened to. She asked if she should not worry and it will go away or should she get to a hospital. She thought she had a problem with her feet (foot problem) but her podiatrist does not know what was going on. She communicated with her physician office today and she said she has never heard of this. She wanted to know if her symptoms have been heard of and if she should go to the hospital. The events did not require a visit to emergency room. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: height as \"5 and three quarters of an inch feet (5'0.75\")\" on an unspecified date; rapid COVID-19 test on 06May2021: negative; regular COVID-19 test on 06May2021: negative; x-ray on 06May2021 to make sure she did not break anything: unknown results.

On 25Mar2021, there's like a big lump. It was swollen yesterday evening too and red and patient put some Benadryl gel on it. States that didn't really help and it was itching and was dizzy. She has this chigger 2x the power for chigger tic and all bug bites, with 10% benzocaine in it, it says fast soothing relief with aloe Vera, states it is for chigger bites.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 08:48 am (lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient previously he was put on prednisone 60 mg tablets by mouth times 7 days, then 10 mg tablets for an additional 7 days. The patient mentioned he received the vaccine in a vaccination center. The patient reported that prior to his first shot towards the end of Jan2021, his doctor thought he had Bell's Palsy. On 20Jan2021, he stated that he was put on a high dose of steroids to clear it up. He stated that on 09Mar2021, he had his first Covid vaccine with no issues. On 12Mar2021 between 5-6 pm, he mentioned that it came back (the Bell's Palsy) with a vengeance, near his eye and with eye droop. He specifies left eye droop. He added that the Monday after (15Mar2021) over the weekend, it got worse. He mentioned that he talked with his neurologist who told him to speak with his ophthalmologist who the patient spoke to on Tuesday. The patient mentioned that both doctors came up with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. He inquired since one of his doctor's is concerned about him taking the second vaccine and the other doctor was ok with it. He mentioned that one doctor had a feeling of some bias, and the other doctor. He did some research in an association with people diagnosed with it. One of his doctors said that he is immunocompromised, so he looked at autoimmune information, and the information says it is ok. He reached out to the local medical center that is doing the vaccination and they are unwilling to talk with him over the phone. He has read on the association site and they seem to recommend to take it. He did not want to rebel against his doctor, so he wants to be sure. He inquired if it was safe for him to take his second dose and wanted to get good factual information that can give him a good starting point that is related. He mentioned that his second dose schedule was on 30Mar2021. He also stated that initial onset of Bell's Palsy with left eye droop, he was on a high dose steroid regimen and that seem to help which he finished up early Feb2021. It was mentioned that the event initial onset was not after the vaccine. The Ophthalmologist checked him on Tuesday and his left eye which he could barely open, and his doctor also noticed right eye droop. He stated without medication, it is worsening but with his medication, it is definitely helping to transmit between nerves. He stated before the medication this time of day he could not lift his left eye longer throughout the day, the more difficult it is for the muscles as they become weaker. There was noticeably drooping of the right eye. The ophthalmologist exam on his right eye was drooping which was ongoing. It is still there, his wife and he were comparing their eyes and how much he could open it, and it surprised them how little he could open it. It was different and strange. The time reported for the drooping of the right eye was 2:30 pm and persisting but the left eye was worse. He hasn't noticed a difference about the same, medication has been helping. It was also mentioned that myasthenia gravis reported that it started on the 16Mar2021 2:30 pm (talked to the Neurologist to compare notes, so maybe 3:30 - 4:00) when they made the initial diagnosis and started testing the next day. He is waiting for blood work to come back, but all the tests have pointed in that direction. Myasthenia gravis was ongoing, but the condition has worsened and the medications at a therapeutic level, it keeps it at bay. He further added that his eye became so hard to see, so he pyridostigmine bromide on 17Mar2021 since he couldn't open or focus, he thought he would give it a try. It works when he can't focus and if he doesn't take, it he will go back to where he was before. He will not be able to open his eye and the double vision will come back. The events required physician's office visit but did not require emergency room visit. He mentioned that there were 3 test and one more scheduled. The first one was a common test; the first initial test diagnose Myasthenia gravis. The second test was the ice test since they went on the assumption in their initial thinking it was Bell's Palsy and in his, doctor's, opinion it didn't look right. The test sounds goofy and it is one of the tests, they did to predict how it was going to go. He reported that they placed an ice cube in a cloth on the eye and let cool for 2-3 minutes. The eye lid is raised more than it was before the test and it went back down. This test was done on 16Mar2021.

Literature citation-  The following is the abstract from the article-  Acute seronegative autoimmune hepatitis is a rare entity but has been reported in the literature. Few cases have been reported where hepatitis occured after yellow fever vaccine. We present a case of acute seronegative autoimmune hepatitis (SAIH) that has probable association with yellow fever vaccine as indicated by the patient's strong history.  This case involves a 35 years old female patient who experienced seronegative autoimmune hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis), while she received vaccine YELLOW FEVER VACCINE.  The patient's past vaccination(s) included yellow fever vaccine. The patient's past medical history, medical treatment(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect YELLOW FEVER VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain (abdominal pain upper), seronegative autoimmune hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis), (Unknown latency) following the administration of YELLOW FEVER VACCINE. This event was assessed as medically significant. The patient was hospitalized for this event.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious jaundice and intermittent low grade fever (pyrexia) (Unknown latency) following the administration of YELLOW FEVER VACCINE. The patient was hospitalized for this event.  On an unknown date, the patient was discharge from the hospital.  Relevant laboratory test results included: Alanine aminotransferase - On an unknown date: 2189 [2189]; on an unknown date: 1146 [1146]; on an unknown date: 603 [603]; on an unknown date: 78 [78] Aspartate aminotransferase - On an unknown date: 2135 [2135]; on an unknown date: 1087 [1087]; on an unknown date: 374 [374]; on an unknown date: 67 [67] Bilirubin conjugated abnormal - On an unknown date: 1.8 [1.8]; on an unknown date: 12.5 [12.5]; on an unknown date: 10.2 Blood albumin - On an unknown date: 3.6 [3.6]; on an unknown date: 2.7 [2.7] Blood alkaline phosphatase - On an unknown date: 213 [213]; on an unknown date: 132 [132]; on an unknown date: 83 [83] Blood bilirubin - On an unknown date: 2.5 [2.5]; on an unknown date: 20.7 [20.7]; on an unknown date: 19.1; on an unknown date: 3.6 [3.6] International normalised ratio - On an unknown date: 1.3 [1.3] Platelet count - On an unknown date: 13.2 [13.2] Protein total - On an unknown date: 7.9 [7.9]; on an unknown date: 7 [7]  (Other relevant tests included CT abdomen was unremarkable for biliary system abnormalities Her viral panel (HSV, EBV, HIV, Hepatitis A-D serology) and autoimmune work-up (ANA, anti DNA, anti smooth muscle, anti mitochondrial, SSA, SSB antibodies turned) were negative. PCR for Yellow fever virus was negative as well. Liver biopsy showed severe chronic active hepatitis (grade III) without fibrosis (grade 0) but with extensive periportal necroinflammatory changes, hence, a working diagnosis of SAIH was made.)  Final diagnosis was Mild seronegative autoimmune hepatitis  The patient was treated with 1 gm METHYLPREDNISOLONE SODIUM SUCCINATE (SOLUMEDROL) and PREDNISONE (PREDNISONE) 40 mg daily. They were able to taper her steroids in the next 4 months with maintenance treatment of 5mg Prednisone.  The outcome of the event was Unknown for all the events.  Conclusion: It is concluded that given the history of this patient, the possibility of association of yellow fever vaccine inducing acute flare of autoimmune hepatitis cannot be ruled out. Further studies to unearth this rare association in detail are warranted.

After 5-10 minutes the pain subsided enough to allow me to continue walking at a slower pace until I reached my destination. At the same time and continuing I had \"fluttering\" in what seemed to be my heart but was never confirmed so perhaps it was my breathing. This fluttering would occur after exercise or exertion and eventually I called my doctor about it and was directed to the ER at Hospital. on 5/17/21. An EKG was done which showed irregularities from one done five weeks previously.   I was given a bed and a heart monitor was attached to me.  A troponin test was done showing 60, which was up from 20 five weeks previously.  I was told this most probably indicated a heart blockage.  An ultra sound on my legs and chest area were performed with no blood clots found.  A heart catheterization was done 5/18/21.  Instead of finding arterial blockage, a Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) event was identified. A CT scan was performed, looking for arrhythmia's with negative results. The heart monitor data was reviewed and my heart was working normally. A baby aspirin per day was prescribed. I was discharged on 5/20/21 and have no ongoing symptoms of the SCAD event. I have no personal or family history of cardiac issues. Furthermore, the fluttering sensation I was experiencing from 5/2/21 through approximately 5/23/21, which I termed a \"heart flutter\" never showed up on the heart monitor data from the hospital.
