{"vid": 1412997, "symptom_text": "Exactly seven days after patient second vaccine, he boarded a 9:10AM flight, with his Dad and sister. Approximately 90 minutes into the flight, as patient watched a movie on his phone (which did not have a photosensitivity warning), he blacked out and doesn't remember anything else until after coming out of a seizure. What others saw, including his father (my husband), was a convulsing 16 year-old (nearly 6' tall and 155 pounds), who was sitting just in front of him, between two strangers. My husband quickly realized what was happening and was totally surprised and struck with some fear, as we have NEVER seen a seizure in our family or in patient before (we have six biological children). The airline called for medical help; a doctor and some other professionals came. My husband had EMT training many years ago, so didn't hold patient body, but did work a few times to keep his head up (patient was seated), so as not to allow the airway to close. Patient sister (age 18) was across the aisle, alone, watching all of the commotion take place, not knowing what to do or how to help, in tears, but handling it with poise and independence. After about 2-3 minutes, the intense convulsing stopped, and his seizure became quieter but still had movement. His eyes were rolled back and he was foaming a bit at the mouth. He was still not responsive. This went on for about 4-5 minutes. Then he stopped. His dad and the doctor asked him basic questions like, \"who are you?\" \"how old are you?\" \"where are you?\" He couldn't answer any other those. Another 3-5 minutes past, and finally he was able to answer \"where are you?\" with \"I'm right here.\" Slowly, he came back to his \"senses\" but of course, was very tired and had a horrible headache afterward. The doctor and my husband decided it was best to have the plane divert to another city  to get patient to a hospital as soon as possible. The three of them had to cancel their trip (work trip for my husband, which our 18- and 16-year-old children were accompanying him on for pleasure and travel). The Airlines was awesome about the whole thing. When the plane landed, they quickly escorted the three off the plane (patient walked slowly, then was put in a wheelchair when they got right off the plane). They were then transferred into an Ambulance and emergently sent to the Hospital. After several hours of waiting and testing, and patient not having any more seizure activity, his CT scan, blood tests, and chest x-ray were normal,  so he was discharged with the instruction to get an MRI with and without contrast upon arrival back home, and then to follow up with a Neurologist. He has been home nearly a week now and feels like himself. He has had the MRI, which came back normal (yay!), but we are waiting to see a Neurologist at hospital. The ONLY thing in patient life that had changed for him in the days, weeks, months preceding this super surprising event, was his Covid #2 Pfizer vaccine. That is why we, and our supportive doctor, are suspicious that this may have been the cause. We are a little nervous about whether or not more seizures will take place, or perhaps his body is done dealing with his probably strong reaction to the immunologic/inflammatory variable. Maybe altitude could have played in, along with the vaccine, and been the straws that broke the camel's back of other things maybe brewing?

Two weeks later, the pain/tightness was still present so I went to urgent care twice over two weeks and received various tests (EKG, blood pressure, blood tests, and echo-cardiagram) and everything appeared normal. Two weeks after the first symptom started I also started experience pain in my limbs. It has now been over two months since the initial symptom and the symptoms are continuing.

I understand 6 weeks is a long time for symptoms to be related to the vaccine, but due to the remarkable similarity between the post-vaccine symptoms and actually having Covid, along with no other presenting illness, I believe they may be related. I have also spoken to others who mentioned having similar ongoing symptoms after vaccine (chest pressure, limb pain).

She thought maybe it was just allergies.  She was at work cutting hair and almost cut a child as she felt dizzy and fatigued and it gradually came on her.  She had to sit down for a while and that feeling did not go away.  Her boss told her to finish and she was about to cut a child and went to her car, and laid in the car all day as she could not drive home.  She was feeling that it was just some allergies.  Called her husband and went to a store within walking distance, and she was holding onto the basket and feeling dizzy and fatigued and was facetiming her husband and then she felt lost, did not know why she was in the store.  She didn't remember where the car was, and walked around for an hour not knowing what to do or why she was there.  She then sat down to try and get her senses and took something for her headache.  She got to the car and zoned out and tried to drive home and was not able to due to the dizziness and fatigue, but could not remember to drive and telling herself to push the gas and was only going about 5 miles an hour.  She called her husband and told him that she could not drive home, and stayed in the parking lot a little bit longer.  It took her 3 hours to get home, which was normally at 20 minute commute.   She went back to her PCP and told her what happened and told her that she did not feel safe, confused, watery mouth and headache.   She then ordered an MRI to see what was going on.  She then tried to get home again and had another episode and was not able to make it home.  She went to the ER and they ran a lot of tests, CT scan, x-rays and told her that all tests were normal.  He then looked at her and did a neurologic test and told her hat he could not send her home and told her that she did not look fine.  She told him that she did not feel safe, and was not able to function.  She gave him a description of how she felt, and told him that she has short term memory problems, and that if she is driving she does not realize that she is.  She was then admitted to the hospital and did 2 more  CT scans, an MRI, blood work and ended up having a neurologist see her, and told her that all her tests were negative.  It was even hard for her to walk and she had to see a therapist for that, and they put her on some medicine for the dizziness and fatigue.  She was in the hospital for 3 days.    She went back to the doctor on Monday and still having the symptoms, but the medicine did help some.  The doctor saw that she could not walk and fell over.  She called the neurologist again and did another blood tests to see if she had COVID prior to the vaccine and doubled up on the medicine for the dizziness which did help with that but the other symptoms were still there, but she was able to walk but not drive.   She had her go to another neurologist to do an MRI of the brain with contrast of the ear part, and she is to go to the doctor today for those results.  From 2/26/21 until now 5/3/21 she has been taking the medicine to function and be able to walk.  She tried to wean herself off the medicine but she is not able to walk and the fatigue comes back.  She still is not able to drive as the short term memory hits her and she forgets where she is and not able to keep up with the speed of the freeway and driving only 10 miles an hour.     She then called the doctor again as she was still having the episodes, she has not been able to work and was told that she probably had to see a neuropsychologist.   She also was filing out paperwork at one point and got a headache and was not able to fill out the paperwork correctly, and did not remember her 16 year olds information.  She is not able to return to work as the company she was working sold the company and she is not able to cut 2 haircuts a day without breathing hard and used to be able to cut 30 a day.  Her body hurts so bad that it feels like if you touch her skin it?s like she had a full work up.  Her doctor told her that she did not have COVID but her body is reacting as if she did.  She is also used to taking care of special needs and autism kids cutting their hair and is upset that she cannot provide for her family and used to work 7 days a week, 7 hours a day.   She is supposed to go to the neurologist today for the results of her MRI (while talking to me she could not remember why she was supposed to go to that doctor).   She was also having an episode and not able to speak to me, starting babbling.  I told her to take a deep breath and she did collect herself.
